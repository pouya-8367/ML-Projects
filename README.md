# ML-Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repo contains a collection of hands-on projects I've implemented using PyTorch, focusing on deep learning for image classification tasks. From custom datasets to transfer learning with EfficientNet models, these projects demonstrate practical ML workflows, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready code.
Whether you're a fellow ML enthusiast, student feel free to explore or contribute. All code is modular, well-documented, and designed for reproducibility.
